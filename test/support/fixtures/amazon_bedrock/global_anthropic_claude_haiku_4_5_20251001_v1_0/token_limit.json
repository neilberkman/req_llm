              "text": "# The Dragon's Legacy: A Tale of Fire and Destiny\n\n## Part One: The Prophecy\n\nThe ancient library of Thornhaven stood silent beneath the pale moonlight, its towering shelves reaching like gnarled fingers toward a vaulted ceiling lost in shadow. Kael Stormsong, a young scholar barely past his twentieth winter, worked by candlelight, his fingers carefully turning the yellowed pages of the Codex Draconis—a text so old that even its binding seemed to whisper secrets of forgotten ages.\n\nThe rain hammered against the tall windows, and Kael shivered, pulling his woolen cloak tighter around his shoulders. He had been searching for three weeks, ever since his mentor, the wise Archimender Torven, had set him this task before his mysterious disappearance.\n\n\"Find the Prophecy of Scales,\" Torven had instructed him, his ancient eyes gleaming with something between urgency and fear. \"When the words align with the stars, the world will need a champion. It must be you, Kael. I have seen it in the Sight.\"\n\nKael had learned long ago not to question Torven's visions. The old man had never been wrong.\n\nAt last, his persistence was rewarded. A passage, written in the old tongue—the language of the First Age—caught his eye. He traced his finger beneath the words, translating slowly:\n\n*\"When the Void opens its eye,*\n*And stars rain fire from the sky,*\n*When the sleepers wake in their mountain halls,*\n*And darkness answers death's own calls,*\n*A child of neither court nor keep,*\n*Shall rouse the dragons from their sleep,*\n*One heart to bind them, one flame to guide,*\n*Through shadow's reach and fate's fierce tide,*\n*The Draconic Crown shall be remade,*\n*Or all of Aethermoor shall fade.\"*\n\nKael's blood ran cold. He had heard stories of the Draconic Crown—not a physical object, but a covenant between the dragons and the other races of Aethermoor, forged in the age when the world was young and dragons still flew openly through the skies. It was said the Crown had been shattered during the Cataclysm, nearly three hundred years ago, when a mage-war between rival dragon lords had nearly destroyed civilization itself. The dragons had withdrawn to their hidden mountains, making a pact to sleep, lest their power destroy everything once more.\n\n\"The Void opens its eye,\" Kael whispered. \"What does that mean?\"\n\nHe was still pondering this when the library doors burst open with a crash that sent his candle flying. Kael jumped to his feet, his hand instinctively moving to the small dagger at his belt—hardly a formidable weapon, but all a scholar could manage.\n\nThree figures stood silhouetted in the doorway, their cloaks dripping with rain and something darker—blood, Kael realized with growing dread.\n\n\"The boy is here,\" one of them called out, a woman's voice, sharp as broken glass. \"Take him alive. The Master wants him intact.\"\n\nKael didn't hesitate. He scooped up the Codex and bolted toward the back of the library, his heart hammering against his ribs. Behind him, he heard the thunder of footsteps, the scrape of steel being drawn.\n\nHe knew the library's layout far better than any stranger would. His fingers flew across the spines of books as he ran, creating a chaos of tumbling volumes behind him to slow his pursuers. The back chamber—where Torven kept his private study—was his destination. The old mage had shown him a secret path once, a tunnel that led beneath the city.\n\n\"Find him!\" the woman's voice rang out again. \"He cannot reach the tunnels!\"\n\nBut Kael's legs were young and swift. He burst into Torven's study, slammed the heavy door, and threw the bolt home. His eyes swept the room frantically, searching for the carved falcon that marked the hidden passage.\n\nThere—on the mantelpiece.\n\nHe seized it and twisted. The fireplace rumbled, stone grinding against stone as a section of the wall slid inward, revealing a gaping darkness beyond. He didn't hesitate to plunge into the blackness, clutching the Codex to his chest.\n\nThe passage descended steeply, and Kael stumbled more than once, striking his shoulder hard against the rough stone walls. Behind him, he heard the study door splintering under repeated impacts. He pushed himself faster, running blind now, trusting his feet to find purchase on the treacherous path.\n\nThen, suddenly, the passage opened, and Kael found himself stumbling into cool night air. He fell forward, hitting soft grass and rolling painfully down an embankment. For a moment, he lay gasping, the breath torn from his lungs.\n\nWhen he finally looked up, he found himself at the edge of the Forgotten Forest, miles from the city. The great trees towered above him like the pillars of ancient temples, their branches forming a canopy so thick that the moonlight barely penetrated. They were said to be older than the kingdoms of men—some whispered they dated back to the First Age itself.\n\nThe sound of his pursuers grew fainter. They had either lost the trail or were taking time to follow properly. Either way, Kael had a chance.\n\nHe stood on shaking legs, looking at the looming forest before him, then at the Codex clutched in his hands. He thought of Torven and his cryptic instructions. He thought of the prophecy he had just discovered.\n\nThere was only one place he could go: he had to find the dragons.\n\n## Part Two: Into the Wilds\n\nThe Forgotten Forest proved to be exactly as its name suggested—wild, untamed, and utterly indifferent to the presence of a single scholar stumbling through its depths. Kael had been walking for two days, surviving on stream water and the dried provisions he'd managed to keep from his pack, now following no path but his own instinct and the occasional sign in the ancient text.\n\nThe Codex had contained more than just the prophecy. Scattered throughout its pages were references to the Dragon Roads—ancient paths that supposedly still connected the old dragon territories. If Kael could find one, if he could decipher the symbols correctly, it might lead him to answers.\n\nOn the third day, weakened by hunger and desperation, he stumbled upon the first true marker: a stone pillar, easily fifteen feet tall, carved with symbols that matched those in the Codex. His hands shook as he pressed his palm against the weathered granite.\n\nThe carvings were warm.\n\nKael jerked his hand back, startled. The stone shouldn't be warm—the morning was cool, and the pillar stood in deep shadow. Yet when he touched it again, there was no denying the heat emanating from within.\n\nA low sound rolled through the forest—not thunder, but something deeper, something that seemed to come from the earth itself. Kael fell to his knees, overwhelmed by the sensation. Every instinct screamed at him that this was wrong, that he was trespassing on something ancient and terrible and wonderful.\n\nThe ground began to glow.\n\nLines of brilliant sapphire light spread outward from the pillar in the shape of concentric circles, illuminating the forest floor in an otherworldly radiance. Kael scrambled backward, his eyes wide with a mixture of terror and awe. These were the Dragon Roads—he was certain of it now. The old magic still lived, still burned with the power of ages.\n\nThe light faded gradually, and Kael noticed something new: a path, visible now beneath the leaf litter, marked by stones identical to the pillar. The Dragon Road had revealed itself to him.\n\nWith the Codex clutched tightly and his courage bolstered by this confirmation that he was on the right path, Kael began to follow the ancient route deeper into the forest.\n\nDays blended into weeks. He rationed his food carefully, learned to hunt fish from streams with crude spears fashioned from fallen branches, and gathered berries and roots from the forest floor. His scholar's hands grew calloused and strong. His scholar's frame grew lean and muscular from the constant travel.\n\nThe forest began to change. The trees grew stranger—some seemed to shift when he wasn't looking directly at them, their trunks twisting into patterns too deliberate to be natural. Strange lights danced between the branches at night—wisps of blue and green that vanished when he reached for them. Once, he glimpsed what he was certain was a stag made entirely of moonlight, standing on a hillside, watching him with eyes of starlight before bounding away through the trees.\n\nIt was magic—true, wild magic, of a kind he had only read about in the oldest texts. It thrilled and terrified him in equal measure.\n\nIt was on the forty-third day of his journey that Kael encountered the first dragon.\n\nHe didn't realize it at first. In his exhaustion, stumbling along the Dragon Road as sunset painted the sky in shades of amber and rose, he mistook the great shape ahead for a massive boulder—a rock outcropping partially buried in moss and time.\n\nThen the \"boulder\" shifted.\n\nKael froze, one foot suspended in mid-step. Slowly, certain movements resolved themselves into meaning: the sinuous curve of a neck, the articulation of a shoulder, the delicate arrangement of what he had taken for fissures in stone but which were actually the overlapping scales of a body that had lain in slumber for untold ages.\n\nThe dragon opened one eye.\n\nIt was enormous, easily larger than the great cathedrals of human cities, its body colored in deep greens and browns that made it nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding forest. Moss and lichen covered its scales. Saplings grew from crevices along its spine. It had been here so long that the forest had begun to reclaim it, as if the line between dragon and stone and earth itself had grown blurred.\n\nThe eye that fixed upon Kael was ancient beyond measure—wise and terrible and infinitely sad.\n\n\"A human,\" the dragon said, its voice like the grinding of continents, like stone singing in geological time. \"I have not seen your kind since the Cataclysm. You are very small and fragile-looking.\"\n\nKael's legs had turned to water. He wanted to run, but every instinct told him that to run from such a creature would be futile and foolish. Instead, he stood perfectly still and managed, in a voice that was barely a whisper, to speak.\n\n\"I... I am Kael Stormsong. I mean you no harm. I come seeking... seeking the dragons.\"\n\nThe dragon's other eye opened. Its head lifted slowly, soil and broken branches cascading from its ancient scales. It raised itself up, coiling its massive body into a more vertical position, its tail—longer than a river, thick as a tower—settling across the forest floor like a bridge.\n\n\"You seek the dragons?\" A sound emerged from the dragon's throat that might have been laughter, though it shook the earth enough to topple small trees. \"Foolish child. The dragons are not to be found by seeking. We have withdrawn. We sleep. We have made our pact with the gods themselves, lest our fire consume all that lives.\"\n\n\"But the prophecy,\" Kael said urgently, finding his voice despite his fear. \"The Prophecy of Scales speaks of a time when the dragons will wake. When they must wake. The Void is opening. I've read it in the Codex—\"\n\n\"The Codex?\" Now the dragon's attention sharpened, and Kael felt the weight of its regard like a physical force. \"You possess the Codex Draconis? That tome was supposed to be lost to time itself.\"\n\nKael, trembling, held up the ancient book. The dragon lowered its great head, and Kael saw intelligence and hunger in those vast golden eyes—not the hunger of predators for prey, but the hunger of a mind isolated for centuries, desperate for knowledge, for connection.\n\n\"Read to me, child,\" the dragon commanded. \"Read the Codex. Let me hear once more the words of my ancestors.\"\n\nAnd there, in the depths of the Forgotten Forest, as twilight deepened into night and the stars began to emerge overhead, Kael Stormsong read to the dragon. He read of the ancient days when dragons had shaped the world with their will, when the kingdoms of men were still young and fragile. He read of the wars and the friendships, the great deeds and the terrible mistakes. He read the prophecy over and over until he had it memorized.\n\nWhen he finished, the dragon was silent for a long time. Then it spoke:\n\n\"My name is Valoryon. I was once a lord of dragons, in the age before the Cataclysm. I chose to sleep rather than see my kind destroy the world with our pride and power. But now, listening to the Prophecy... I wonder if we have slept too long. I wonder if in trying to protect the world, we have abandoned it.\"\n\nThe dragon stood fully now, stretching its massive wings, sending up clouds of dust that glowed pale gold in the starlight.\n\n\"Tell me, Kael Stormsong of the Codex. Tell me truly: is the world ready for the dragons to wake?\"\n\n## Part Three: The Quest\n\nOver the following weeks, Kael found himself in a strange companionship with Valoryon. The dragon, after centuries of solitude, had become fascinated by the scholar's tales of the modern world. In exchange, Valoryon shared with him knowledge from the ancient days—history that had been lost, written out of textbooks and legends, now preserved only in the dragon's memory.\n\nMore importantly, Valoryon became Kael's teacher.\n\n\"If you are to be the bridge between our worlds,\" the dragon explained, \"you must understand what you are attempting. The other dragons will not wake for the mere saying of an old prophecy. You must prove yourself worthy. You must gather the Draconium—the five artifacts of power that once symbolized the unity of the Dragon Council.\"\n\n\"But the dragon lords were defeated,\" Kael protested. \"The Cataclysm scattered them. How can I hope to gather artifacts from a time that has passed into history?\"\n\n\"History is not past when dragons are involved, young scholar,\" Valoryon said, his enormous tail sweeping across the forest, creating a path where great trees fell like grass before a scythe. \"The artifacts do not vanish—they persist in the places where dragons last held sway. They sleep as we sleep, waiting for one with the courage and the destiny to claim them.\"\n\nAnd so began the true adventure.\n\nThe first artifact, Valoryon told him, was the Helm of Aldric the Mighty, hidden in the ruins of the capital city of the First Dragon Empire—a civilization that had been destroyed ten thousand years ago. The city, called Drakenmoor, lay far to the north, buried beneath the ice of the Shattered Peaks.\n\nValoryon himself could not retrieve it—dragons of his age and power could not survive the extreme cold without enormous effort. But he knew the way, and he provided Kael with something far more valuable than armor or weapons: he gave him the ability to read the old magic.\n\nIt took weeks of training, with Valoryon guiding him through meditation and concentration, until Kael could feel the pulse of magical energy that flowed through the world like an invisible current. The dragon taught him to see the world as dragons saw it—not with eyes alone, but with something deeper, a perception that revealed the true nature of things.\n\n\"Magic flows through all living things,\" Valoryon explained as they sat one evening on a hillside overlooking a vast valley. \"The mountains themselves are alive with it. The rivers sing it. Even humans, for all that you have largely forgotten how to touch it, carry it within your blood. Your scholar's mind gives you an advantage, Kael. You think in symbols and meanings. Magic is itself a form of language—learn to speak it, and you can accomplish wonders.\"\n\nArmed with this training and with supplies gathered from Valoryon's hoard—ancient tools and maps that still possessed traces of old magic—Kael set out toward the Shattered Peaks.\n\nThe journey took him through lands both familiar and strange. He passed through the holdings of men, moving quietly and carefully, for he knew that questions about his destination would only bring trouble. In a small village called Tarn's Rest, he hired a guide named Mira, a woman of perhaps thirty winters with sharp eyes and sharper wit. She was a merchant's daughter gone native to the wilderness, and she asked no questions when Kael offered good coin for her services.\n\nIn fact, Mira was more useful than even payment warranted. She knew routes and shortcuts, had contacts in small settlements and trading posts, and more importantly, she was excellent company. As they traveled together through forests and across moorlands, Kael found himself looking forward to her dry humor and her stories of life on the frontier.\n\n\"You're running from something,\" she said one evening, as they camped beneath a sky brilliant with stars. \"Or toward something. The desperate ones always have that look in their eyes. But you're different."
